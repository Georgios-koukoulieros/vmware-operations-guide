If the KPI of the engineers are based on Uptime on the network they support, how would these engineers have the room to try out new technologies? Usually these KPIs are tie to their year end bonuses, therefore any new techologies introduced which might impact the service availiability of the network, anyone in their shoes would follow the mindset of not changing of the existing network. 

These engineers are usually the inhabitors to change. When an organization is trying to do digital transformation, its invitable to introduce new technology such as modernizing applications and cloud. So if the engineers KPI are not align to the business transformation vision, its going to be counter productive. 

Therefore, its important for people managers and it has to be organization wide, for example, from CIO to Architects to Operation Engineers, their KPI need to be adjusted so that nothing is stopping them in supporting the transformation that the organization is going through.
