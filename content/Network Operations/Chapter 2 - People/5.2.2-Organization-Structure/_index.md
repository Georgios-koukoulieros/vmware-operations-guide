Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset

Operating a virtual network requires new skillsets and thus the engineers who are tasked to operate these networks needs to have a positive mindset. So what do we mean by positive mindset? We can actually learn from Carol Dweck Growth Mindset. 

Basically a person with growth mindset think that anything can be learned or trained while a person with an opposite mindet ie. fixed minset thinks that his/her ability is limited and somethings just cannot be learned or improved.
