The first part of the book explains the art of Operations Management in the context of VMware cloud architecture. It is a pre-requisite to Part 2.

What you architect is SDDC. But what you handover as a business result to your CIO is IaaS. One is a system, the other is a service. We can assess if the architecture is good or not, based on the actual result in production. Does it result in firefighting and blamestorming? Or do you have a peaceful operation where alerts are meaningful and actionable?
