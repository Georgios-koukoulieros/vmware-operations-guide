vSphere Metrics is an opensource book. At >200 pages, it's the most complete documentation that we know of.

Check out the [step by step instruction](https://github.com/TheNewStellW/vmware-operations-guide/wiki) on how to contribute.

The book covers 3 types of metrics: 
1. vCenter metrics, focusing on the performance metrics tab. Other counters are not yet documented.
2. ESXi metrics, focusing on **esxtop**. Other counters are not yet documented.
3. VMware Tools metrics.
